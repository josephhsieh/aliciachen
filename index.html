One day I finally got to talk to him and he said: “I’m 21, born and grew up in Toronto, besides woking here as a cook, I run a small recording studio and the business is getting more and more established. To save my time, I keep my wardrobe small and dress only in black. This habit was inspired by Mark Zuckerberg (who buys many t-shirts that are exactly the same)! I also read lots of business articles and entrepreneur’s interviews. This full-time job is to pay bills while I’m reaching my goal as a musician/producer.” I remember how his eyes were so full of innocence, sincerity and excitement saying these lines!

Places where my my language was of no use, where cell phone signal was as common as a unicorn sighting; where familiar was something you’d crave like your favourite drug. And I survived. More than that, I learned to love those moments. It wasn’t always easy. And It still isn’t. But when you really stop and get honest, you are NEVER alone. We are a collective. Every moment you’ve shared with another human can continue to exist within you if you want it to. And what’s really transformed my life is figuring out that if you can find a way to walk with that invisible army of friends and lovers and hearts behind you, not only will you not be alone, but there’s a line-up of gorgeous, new soldiers that can't wait to enlist. Learn to love you, all alone, and people will wage war in your favor. Sitting there, in that moment, I had no proof that I would make it to where I am today. But in just one tiny year I’ve become a certified yoga practitioner, wandered up the Himalayas, re-started my acting career, starred in my first commercial and film, become a business owner & mentor (which has now expanded to a team of five incredible women!!), learned to love again, co-founded a successful charitable initiative and community platform and am about to take off to Las Vegas, DC and New York where I will continue to expand my business, my relationships, and most importantly, myself. I share all that only because I want you really know that we're alone in only one thing, and that’s creating a vision of what we want our lives to look like: How big and how beautiful. THERE'S NO LIMIT.… If you can dream it, you can do it. Your thoughts really do become things! So why not take today to think about what’s really possible? Because I promise you, IT IS POSSIBLE. It might not feel like it. It might be a terrifying and trying journey, but the only thing that might be more painful... is never actually trying at all. You’re not alone. Go get 'em.” - Helen, entrepreneur/actor/ writer Toronto/New York 💋">

She said: ''I've thought about this numerous times. Rather than changing anything, I've embraced it all and believed in karma. What goes around comes around. I've seen Karma come after everyone eventually. How people treat you is their karma; how you react is yours.'' This powerful woman sacrificed her entire youth to support both her own family as well as her second family- financially, emotionally and physically-- all while fearing that she might be sent away again. Early on, she was adopted by a poor peasant family as her original family couldn't afford to raise her. Since her early 20s, she faced ruthless shaming from her community because she chose to divorce an unfaithful husband. Life was difficult, but she kept silent and worked hard to educate her only daughter. There is no woman who cared for me and my sister quite as well as she did. For a woman who's sole reason for survival is to raise her child and care for her loved ones. I was never able to sense her suffering from severe depression because she never complained. An exceptional tailer, she was always sewing clothes, strewing them across the house in piles and piles. Life was extremely difficult for uneducated Taiwanese single mothers who belonged to the last generation. Taiwan's patriarchal society did not lend women much respect, and requiring them to work with their hands without rest. Despite her tight schedule, she exuded a wisdom and a unique grace— an incredible intelligence and determination to learn. It is from her that I learned creativity as well as several other life lessons. As she always says ''I pray for the people I love and the ones who have made wrongful assumptions about me. I hope the universe brings good karma and solves this negativity, leaving everyone with peace.'' 🐳">

This caused me to become hyper aware of my own mortality at a young age. Aside from this, I never really felt that her death impacted me the way death usually impacts people - to some extent I felt like it didn't impact me at all. This changed later in life when I realized just how much my life trajection altered without her being here. I often think of how different my life would be if she was alive- where I'd be living, the people I'd know, the type of personality traits I would have developed or gained from being around her. I'm often told I'm like her - calm and collected, but loud and boisterous when I want to be. She was attentive, and had a type of magnetism that made people want to talk to her - family members say I get that trait from her. The main issue that I struggle with at the moment is; explaining my situation to others. Just like anything else, no one will truly know your lived experiences unless they go through a similar scenario. To outsiders, I've tried explaining the balancing act I've had to do my entire life and the complexity of emotions within those of my immediate family. Despite my best attempts, no one truly understands to the depth I would like them to. There has only been one other person who understood the intricacy of being an only child with a single parent, and I thank them for entering my life the way they did. They made me realize that I'm not alone. I'm a firm believer in things happening for a reason, even when things turn to hell. I believe there is a purpose behind everyone you meet, everything you experience and everything someone chooses to do or not do. I live my life believing in a constant push and pull within the universe. That these forces that you may not initially notice, drive people to discover their purpose and life fulfillment. It's just up to individuals to take advantage of those forces when they strike. I'd like to think that her absence in my life has made me a stronger, more resilient, and more self-reliant person than I would have been if she was around...'' - Maria, entrepreneur/artist/wonder woman from Toronto 🌻.">

It was as though I had to relearn how to trust myself, both with respect to my professional and personal abilities, in order to move passed what I had experienced. I had risked everything and failed - believing I wasn't a failure myself was the most difficult part of my recovery. Accepting that in life, we don't always make the right choices and it isn't a reflection of our capabilities felt impossible at the time. It has been almost a year to the day that I came back from Europe and I still don't know where I found the courage to pack up and leave an unhealthy relationship. At the time, I was broken and felt unworthy of love, I'd had my chance and lost it. It is only with the support of my parents and my dear friends that I learnt to rebuild and trust myself in a relationship again. Being acutely aware that I am hypersensitive to my environment was also part of my learning. Now, I find myself thriving once again, understanding that I can and should put myself first before giving to someone else. The reality of having suffered from depression is that the fear of falling back in is always there. Though the process was one of the hardest things I ever went through, I learnt so much about myself, my resilience, and my ability to forge a path for myself that I can respect and admire. Now, I wake up every morning and I am grateful for the support I have around me, for it reminds me that with a strong network of family and friends, I can conquer anything, even depression. - Farz, TD bank product manager grew up in Montreal, Brussels and now resides in Toronto 🍁">

In a way, I did kill myself. I killed the parts of me that needed to die to make room for the woman I wanted to be... I realized that the microdecisions involved in art were the literal movements of my heart, which manifest real moments with great effect, rippling fractals into the future. It clicked for me that each moment is an opportunity to take control, to decide whether to push reality in one direction or another, just like whether to push the paint a little to the left, or whether to darken a shadow. These decisions are just as meaningless as a careless brushstroke, and just as beautiful. Life doesn't need meaning. Life can be Art, by taking ownership of every moment; grasping the swordhilt of true freedom. Choosing not to destroy myself was my commitment to push each moment to be the most aesthetically pleasing version of itself I could sense it could be, because that is the standard I hold myself to in order to balance the overwhelming weight of suicidal ideation with an equally weighted satisfaction at the aesthetic of my life. Only Love can outweigh all that black cynicism. So I seek to manifest an aesthetic of Love, and I never feel obliged to justify the process or the result. If I haven't died, the Love is self-evident. Now, suicide is the last weapon of freedom that I hold in my heart, reserved for political protest should that become necessary, if for instance I was under inescapable oppression and the true freedom of my life as an Artist, and my children's birthright to claim this freedom, were to be oppressed. I hold great power, and I know that I am not the only one who does.

The key factors making them succeed are a bit of money, plenty of opportunities and full of guts. As a future successor of a growing global enterprise, I am expected, forced to learn and act like a leader at age 27. I fully devote myself into work, ignore my fear, doubts and anxiety, and try to grow as fast as I can. I am not sure if this is the right direction but I have no time to think. An ideal day to spend would be being alone in my own European-style space, and blocking myself from work, expectation and responsibility. I would read, lay back, and enjoy my favorite Earl Grey tea with dark chocolate to create a scenario as if I wasn't in China.'' Jessica, CEO from Taiwan, now lives in China ☕️">
      <img src="images/May.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="13/100 May, 2016, graphite on paper. When May divorced an irresponsible ex husband and ran her own business in a suburb near Shanghai, people always rumoured about her private life. Past age 30, a woman in China expires in the eyes of her peers. Rather than treated with due respect, single mothers are commonly frowned upon.Fortunately for May, she came from a wealthy family, who supported her passion for conceptual art. She made the decision to move back to Vancouver, finally severing ties with a society which never granted her belonging. People in China neither understood her nor her art. Unlike most of Vancouver's Chinese upper class, May never felt the need to show off her designer goods nor to buy into the ever-popular luxury lifestyle. Similarly, she didn't share the other women's obsessions with everlasting youth, and shied away from widespread self-beautification techniques. She's sought ways to establish her own business in a manner suitable for her son and her talent in fine art. At all times she has remained a humble and caring friend. It is this from which her beauty derives. ''During the years I lived in China, people didn't pay much attention to my talent or ability but rather gossiped about my private life, my marriage and my age. I chose not to go with that flow. I've never regretted having my son, he's the best thing that happened to me and I don't need another man to support me because I'm strong myself.'' - May, single mother/business owner from China now lives in Vancouver. 🌲">
      <img src="images/Ciara.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="1/100 Alla, 2016, graphite and charcoal on paper. ''When I was little, I refused to answer the question 'what do you want to be when you grow up'. I thought that it was unfair of people to ask little 7 year old me to decided who I was going to be and do for the rest of my life. You see I was under the impression that this was a serious question and my answer would literally decide my fate. Of course that faded as I grew older; I bounced around from many potential professions and it's funny but to this day I think part of me still thinks like that 7 year old girl. I have a hard time keeping a job because I am always looking for the next best thing. I want to always evolve and learn and it saddens me that people expect me to be any different. I don't want a career , I want a life worths more than one capability. So life has lately made it quite clear that I don't fit in with what's expected. I am never where I am supposed to be and sometimes it takes me forever to get to same place I started from. But I am starting to realize there is nothing wrong with that. I will be the fault that needs no fixing and people will eventually learn that it's ok to be the same.'' -Alla, photographer/writer/desk clerk from LA, California. 🦄">

      <h4>Alicia Chen</h4>
      <p>Alicia Chen was born in Taiwan and became a new immigrant to Canada in 2015. Chen’s art journey started internationally from Taipei to Vancouver, New York to Toronto, where she presently resides. Chen spends much of her time collaborating and working with art professionals from recognizable institutions and building strong relationships within the art community. Based off of her rich and unique life experiences as an artist, art educator, young business entrepreneur and curator, she creates artwork cemented in the act of storytelling, showing unique capability for capturing the essence of her subjects. For Chen, art is a way of visually documenting her life through the connections she forms and infusing it with meaning. Art is a way of evolving oneself and empowering the minority. With her art gallery curating and marketing background, she is also as an active curator in Toronto’s Asian Canadian communities involving in conducting and coordinating cultural events and film festivals between Taiwanese bureaucracy and Toronto-based charity and nonprofit organizations where she aim to bring diversity together and to make social changes.

        <h3>100faces Project</h3>
        <p>Hopelessness, isolation and disconnection lurk underneath the surface of everyday life. It is these core, but lesser vocalized human experiences that form the epicentre of artist Alicia Chen’s visual world, and serve as building blocks for her people-focused artistic studies. Working from graphite, charcoal and pastels on paper, Chen documents the extraordinary personal histories of her subjects and translates them onto the page with painstaking detail. With each portrait, she probes the triumphs and struggles faced by everyday people in their everyday lives against the backdrop of a rapidly changing social landscape. The face being the most basic line of connection, Chen’s ‘100 Faces’ project is an effort to depict the human face, as it really is, so that it can serve as a powerful mirror through which our internal states can be shared with others. In the course of Chen’s life, she has overcome tremendous hardship and as such has spent her life seeking out encounters with people whose lives are steeped in tales of personal growth. Invariably, she found that above all, it is our faces that wear these experiences— which conceal and reveal who we are in the profoundest of ways. Portrait by portrait, she uncovers the history behind the lines and imperfections etched in their faces. By actively including individuals from all walks of life in her work, Chen hopes to do her part in constructing an honest reflection of Toronto’s rich and variegated contemporary political reality.
